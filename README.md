This is a filler README to get the repo initialized.

## Running locally with emulator. 

To set up the emulator, install the (Firebase Local Emulator Suite)[https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure].
The firebase.json files have already been set up for this project, and so there is no need to run `firebase init` here. 

Check out the slurp/src/main/webapp/scripts/init_firebase.js file for additional information.
